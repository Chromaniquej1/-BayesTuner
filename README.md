# Bayesian Approach on Hyperparameter Optimization for Neural Network Design

## Objective
This project aims to develop an efficient and scalable methodology for optimizing hyperparameters of a neural network using Bayesian optimization. The primary objective is to improve the predictive accuracy and computational efficiency of the model when applied to a multi-class classification dataset.

Hyperparameter tuning is a critical step in the development of effective neural network models. Traditional methods like grid search and random search are often computationally expensive and inefficient, especially when the parameter space is large. Bayesian optimization offers a more intelligent approach by iteratively exploring the parameter space using probabilistic models.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of socioeconomic and geographic data points with the feature set such as:
- **Income**
- **Age**
- **Subscriptions**

The target variable involves classifying the customers into multiple product categories. Bayesian optimization is employed to fine-tune key hyperparameters such as:
- Dropout rate
- Learning rate
- Neural network architecture

## Research Questions
1. How can Bayesian optimization improve the efficiency and accuracy of hyperparameter tuning for neural networks compared to traditional methods like grid search or random search?
2. What is the impact of optimal hyperparameter configurations on the overall performance and generalizability of a neural network for multi-class classification tasks?

**Goal:** Efficiently optimize neural network hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization to enhance performance and reduce computational costs for multi-class classification tasks.

## Proposed Methodology

### 1. Model Design
A flexible neural network architecture is defined and parameterized by:
- **Dropout rate**: Controls regularization.
- **Neuron percentage**: Determines the number of neurons relative to a base count.
- **Neuron shrinkage rate**: Specifies the rate of neuron reduction across layers.

### 2. Bayesian Optimization
- Define the objective function to minimize validation loss using the specified hyperparameters.
- Use the Bayesian optimization library to efficiently search the space.

| **Parameter Name**   | **Proposed Range** |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Dropout rate          | 0 – 0.499         |
| Learning rate         | 0.0001 – 0.1      |
| Neuron percentage     | 0.01 – 1.0        |
| Neuron shrinkage rate | 0.01 – 1.0        |

## Expected Outcomes
1. A trained neural network optimized for multi-class classification tasks with improved performance metrics (e.g., reduced log-loss).
2. Insights into the influence of key hyperparameters on the model's performance.
3. A reusable framework for Bayesian optimization applicable to other machine learning models.

## Tools and Libraries
1. **Programming Language**: Python
2. **Frameworks and Libraries**:
   - PyTorch: Neural network implementation.
   - Scikit-learn: Data preprocessing and evaluation metrics.
   - BayesianOptimization: Hyperparameter tuning.
   - Pandas and NumPy: Data manipulation.
   - Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization.

## Success Criteria
1. Achieving a significant improvement in model performance (e.g., lower log-loss or higher accuracy) compared to baseline models.
2. Reduction in computation time for hyperparameter optimization relative to grid/random search.
